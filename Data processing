# this file is for uploading and sorting data
# data will be assessed for cause of death, number of deaths, and (if applicable) sex of the deceased.
# we will be investigating whether sex makes an individual more prone to a certain ailment or disease
# if sex does affect how prone a person is, we also want to identify which sex contributes to that vulnerability
