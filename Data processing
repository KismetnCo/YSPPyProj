# this file is for uploading and sorting data --- WARNING: All graphs are pretty limited, will become more important as more data is introduced (@ the weekend)

'''data will be assessed for cause of death, number of deaths, and sex of the deceased.
 we will be investigating whether sex makes an individual more prone to a certain ailment or disease
 if sex does affect how prone a person is, we also want to identify which sex contributes to that vulnerability
 ++ this is over the years / over the months, so take it with a grain of salt- we're going to be looking at overall trends
 so mostly percents of deaths in populations/overwhelmingly high-density causes
