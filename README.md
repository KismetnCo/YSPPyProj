# YSPPyProj
This is my project for YSP's python B course. 
[WIP]

Research question:
- Which causes of death (neurological, muscular, cardio, respiratory), are most common /
more fatal to a given population (@ higher recorded death rates for males, females,
different races)

Expected coding work to be done:
- We expect to combine, format, and visualise data according to cause of death, sex, and
frequency, and then evaluate for summary statistics (for example: frequency based on
sex) for comparison to general population rates.

Packages:
- Numpy and pandas
- 
Possible Datasets to be used:
● https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/AH_Monthly_Provisional_Counts_of_Deaths_for_Select_Causes_of_Death_by_Sex__Age__and_Race_and_Hispanic_Origin

● https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/New_York_City_Leading_Causes_of_Death

Additional Considerations:
- The datasets don’t all contain the same information, for example, not all data sets include
specific diseases/disease groups. Timeframe for data sets may vary, environmental factors may
apply.

Expected results:
- Sex and/or other demographics will have an effect on frequency of fatality. (Males will be
more prone to heart and respiratory diseases.)
